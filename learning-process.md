# Learning Process

## Question 1:
### What is the Feynman Technique?
The Feynman Technique, as a learning technique, involves learning a topic through a deep understanding of it that can be explained as simply as possible to someone new to it.

## Question 2:

Most interesting story or idea from “Learning How to Learn” (Barbara Oakley)

The most interesting concept that I have heard so far is the idea that having difficulty with a problem does not equal failure, but rather it's a part of the process. According to Barbara Oakley, when we have difficulty with something, our brain is actually building new connections. I have always thought that being confused meant failure, but I realize now that it really means we are making progress even if we don't realize it.

## Question 3:

### What are active and diffused modes of thinking?

Active (Focused) Mode:
This mode of thinking is employed when one is concentrating perfectly on a task, for instance, solving a programming puzzle. It is logical and methodical.

Diffused Mode:
It is effective when one is relaxed, either during walks, while sleeping, or even during breaks. It is useful in seeing the bigger picture. Both modes are essential, and they work together well.
