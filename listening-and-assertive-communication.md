# **Listening and Active Communication**

## Active Communication

### Question 1: 
The strategy to do active listening is to stop multitasking and focus on the speaker. As a listener, we have to maintain eye contact with the speaker and also not interrupt him/her.

## Reflective Listening

### Question 2:
 
- Listen carefully to what the speaker is saying without judging.
- Paraphrase the reflection of the message and check understanding.
- Identify the emotions of the speaker (joyful, mad, puzzled, stressed).
- Confirm if your understanding is accurate.
- Clarify misunderstandings immediately, rather than assuming.
- Speak in a calm and neutral tone to ensure the other person feels safe and heard.

## Reflection

### Question 3: 

Problems in my process of listening are the distractions of my phone and my environment; I am too busy thinking of my own response.

### Question 4:

Strategies to enhance my listening are to make conscious practice of active listening a part of each day. Reduce distractions while conversing with someone.

## Types of Communication 

### Question 5:

I move into passive communication in daily life when talking to seniors, when I do not want to start a conflict, when I am not confident, and when I feel my opinion is not important.

### Question 6:

In my daily life, I engage in aggressive communication when I feel disrespected, when a person ignores my point repeatedly, during intense arguments, when I'm under pressure or tired, or when I'm feeling angry.

### Question 7: 

As for me, I behave passive-aggressively when I am upset yet do not want to deal with confrontation, when I complain to other people about the person instead of complaining to him/her myself.

### Question 8:

I can ensure that my communication becomes assertive by employing “I feel …” or “I think …” in place of blaming, maintaining a relaxed demeanor with eye contact, and respecting other people and myself.
