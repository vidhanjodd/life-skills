# REST Architecture

REST is an acronym for Rpresentational State Transfer and is a simple method of creating web services. Here’s how it works: Everything is a resource (users, products, posts) with a web address.

## Core Components of REST Architecture

- Client: Sends requests for resources.
- Server: Hosts and serves resources.
- Resource: Any  info or object is accessible via the API.
- HTTP Methods: it has standard operations like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.

## Benefits of Using Rest Architecture

- Scalability: It is scalable because it decouples Client And Server, that helps in scaling on Platforms like AWS or Kubernetes.
- Flexibility: It works on any platform mobile, web. 
- Performance: It is fast in speed, reliable and efficient.
- Less Complexity: Becuase it avoids SOAP and WSDL
- Stateless: Each and Every request is independent.

## Why Use REST

Becuase it is scalable, flexible and also gives high performance, also it is loose coupled. Requests are independent of each other.
